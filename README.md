# **Examples of analytical models**

These are some examples of projects i have created to solve some real world problems.


- [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](#lda) - Topic modeling for service desk.
- [Web scraping](#web-scraping) - Web scraping, fuzzy match and nltk on lovemonday's website (https://www.lovemondays.com.br) to evaluate a company automatically.

# **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**

## **Motivation**
Not always when an employee opens a call to the service desk, it places a category that matches the text of the call. This makes it difficult to identify how many calls the bot can automate. Therefore, we needed an algorithm that would separate the called ones into topics so that the business analyst could categorize these topics.

# **Web scraping**

## **Motivation**
The company always made a manual report of how their ratings were on the lovemondays website so they could take action for possible improvements. However, since the report was manual, it could not assess competitors or even identify the most commonly used words in pros and cons.
